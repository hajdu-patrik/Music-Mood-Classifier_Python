A Python-based NLP system and web application that analyzes the emotional profile of song lyrics and recommends songs with a similar mood. The project was developed as part of the **BME-VIK "Natural Language and Semantic Technologies"** course.

> **🚀 Optimization Update:** This project has been heavily optimized for Serverless Deployment (Vercel). It runs **without** heavy libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, or NLTK in production, keeping the total unzipped size under 120MB.

## 🚀 Live Demo

**Check out the live version of the application here:**
👉 **[https://music-mood-classifier-nine.vercel.app](https://music-mood-classifier-nine.vercel.app)**

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎭 **Emotion Classification** – 6 categories: *sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, surprise*
- 🎶 **Similarity-Based Recommendation** – Uses native Matrix Multiplication (Dot Product) on TF-IDF vectors.
- 🚀 **High Performance** – Optimized for speed and low memory usage using Sparse Matrices (`.npz`) and Compressed JSON (`.json.gz`).
- 🌐 **Web Interface** – Clean, responsive UI with Dark/Light mode support.
- ⚡ **Serverless Ready** – Designed to run within strict size limits of cloud functions.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Production (Runtime)
These libraries are used to run the web application:
- **Web Server:** Flask
- **Math & Logic:** NumPy, SciPy (Sparse Matrices)
- **Data Handling:** Native Python JSON, Gzip
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

### Development (Training Phase)
The models were originally trained using:
- **ML/NLP:** Scikit-learn, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression
- **Data:** Pandas, NLTK
*(Note: These are not required to run the deployed app)*

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hajdu-patrik/Music-Mood-Classifier_Python.git
cd Music-Mood-Classifier_Python
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

**Windows (Git Bash):**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Web App

Since the models are pre-trained and optimized, you can start the server immediately:
```bash
python app/app.py
```

The server will be available here:
- http://127.0.0.1:5000
- http://localhost:5000
